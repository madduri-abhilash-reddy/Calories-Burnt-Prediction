# Calories Burnt Prediction

This project demonstrates the development of a machine learning model to predict the number of calories a person burns during a workout, based on various biological features.

## 📚 Abstract

The model uses Python libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Scikit-learn** for data manipulation, visualization, and training. After loading and preprocessing the data, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** identifies key relationships between features like Age, Height, Weight, and Duration with the target variable, **Calories**.

Data normalization is performed, and models such as:
- Linear Regression
- XGBRegressor
- Lasso
- Random Forest Regressor
- Ridge Regression

are trained and evaluated using **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**. The **Random Forest Regressor** and **XGBRegressor** achieved the best performance.

This project offers a practical guide to building and evaluating predictive models for fitness and health data analysis.
